How to Set Up a MariaDB Server

Install MariaDB:

  sudo apt update

  sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y

Once installed, start and enable the MariaDB service:

  sudo systemctl start mariadb

  sudo systemctl enable mariadb

Secure the Installation:

  sudo mysql_secure_installation

You’ll be prompted to:

    Set a root password.
    Remove anonymous users.
    Disallow remote root login.
    Remove the test database.

Answer “yes” to these prompts for maximum security.

To confirm MariaDB is running, check its status:

  sudo systemctl status mariadb

Log in to MariaDB to test the installation:

  sudo mariadb

If the prompt changes to MariaDB [(none)]>, the installation was successful.

Create a Database. Once logged into MariaDB, create a database with the following commands:

  CREATE DATABASE my_database;
  CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  EXIT;

This creates a database named my_database and a user named my_user with full privileges (change the names if you want).

Test Database Connectivity. To test the database connection, use the following command:

  mysql -u my_user -p

Enter the password you set for my_user. If successful, you’ll see the MariaDB prompt.

Integrate MariaDB with PHP. Install the PHP extension for MariaDB:

  sudo apt install php-mysql -y

Restart Apache to apply the changes:

  sudo systemctl restart apache2

You should now be able to use PHP to connect to MariaDB and run database queries.
