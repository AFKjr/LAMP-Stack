Setting Up PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. This guide explains how to install and configure PHP as part of your LAMP stack.

Install PHP. Run the following command to install PHP and its dependencies:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y

Verify PHP Installation. Create a PHP test file to ensure PHP is working:

  echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php

Visit http://localhost/info.php in your browser. You should see the PHP info page, which displays details about your PHP installation.

Install PHP Extensions. To extend PHP functionality, install additional modules as needed. For example, to connect PHP to MariaDB:

  sudo apt install php-mysql -y

After installing new modules, restart Apache to apply the changes:

  sudo systemctl restart apache2

Configure PHP. The main PHP configuration file is located at:

  /etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini

Open it for editing:

  sudo nano /etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini

Replace <version> with your installed PHP version (e.g., 8.2). Common settings to modify:

    upload_max_filesize: Increase upload file size limit.
    memory_limit: Increase memory allocation for scripts.
    display_errors: Enable or disable error reporting.

Restart Apache after making changes:

  sudo systemctl restart apache2

Secure PHP. For a production environment, ensure PHP is secure:

    Disable unnecessary modules.
    Turn off error display on live sites (display_errors = Off).
    Regularly update PHP to the latest version:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade -y

Test a Dynamic PHP Script. Create a simple PHP script to confirm everything is working:

  echo "<?php echo 'Hello, World!'; ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/hello.php

Visit http://localhost/hello.php. You should see Hello, World! displayed on the page.
